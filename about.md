# Fool's Trail Cutting

Mod that **ATTEMPTS** to *RECREATE* the Trail Cutting effect from versions 2.1 and prior that occurred when playing on high FPS values. Instead of relying on FPS, this mod relies on a configurable frequency value, which will define how much time passes in-between each trail cut.

This is my first ever Geode mod, so it's definitely nowhere near perfect and it's surely not the best way to replicate this visual, but it's there as a cheap alternative for those that want it and either can't use another option or play on Android, where it's normally not accessible.
