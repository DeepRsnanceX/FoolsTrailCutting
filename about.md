# Fool's Trail Cutting

Mod that **<cy>ATTEMPTS</c>** to ***<cj>RECREATE</c>*** the <cp>Trail Cutting</c> effect from versions 2.1 and prior that occurred when playing on high FPS values. <cy>Instead of relying on FPS, this mod relies on a configurable frequency value, which will define how much time passes in-between each trail cut.</c>

This is my first ever Geode mod, so it's definitely nowhere near perfect and it's surely not the best way to replicate this visual, but it's there as a cheap alternative for those that want it and either can't use another option or play on Android, where it's normally not accessible.

## Why the name?

<cs>Pyrite</c> is a mineral that is known as "<cy>Fool's Gold</c>" due to it looking very similar to gold, but <cr>absolutely not being gold</c> in the slightest. Similarly, <cl>this mod gives a similar visual effect to Trail Cutting</c>, but is absolutely <cr>nowhere near being a faithful remake of the original visual bug, nor does this mod unfix the bug.</c>
